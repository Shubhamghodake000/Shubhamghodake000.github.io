# Shubham S. Ghodake
## About Me
I am a second-year PhD student at the **Department of Computational and Data Sciences**, **Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore**, where I work at the intersection of mathematics, computation, and quantum information theory under the guidance of **Dr. Ratikanta Behera**. My research focuses on **tensor analysis**, **machine learning**, and **quantum computation**. I am a **Junior Research Fellowship (JRF)** scholarship holder, which supports my doctoral research at IISc. Outside of research, I enjoy baking, drawing, and reading mangaâ€”activities that provide a creative counterbalance to my mathematical work.
### Research Interests
- **Tensor Analysis**: Exploring tensor decompositions and their applications in data science and quantum systems
- **Machine Learning**: Developing algorithms that leverage tensor methods for efficient learning
- **Quantum Computation**: Investigating quantum algorithms and quantum machine learning approaches
