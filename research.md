## Projects

### 1. Review: Efficient Computations of Encodings for Quantum Error Correction  
**Type:** Literature Review  
**Summary:**  
In this report, we analyze different methods to construct an efficient gate array that computes the code words for any stabilizer code with any set of generators. We present both standard and fault-tolerant approaches to encoding implementation, with a focus on minimizing gate complexity while maintaining error correction capabilities.

**Type:** Research Project (Paper Communicated)  
**Summary:**  
Developed and implemented algorithms for computing the Moore-Penrose inverse for time varying tensors under M-product architecture usinf zeroing neural networks (ZNN).Currently this work is under review.
